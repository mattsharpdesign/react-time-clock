# timeclock-react

A time clock web app built with React, Semantic UI, and Firebase.

Records employee start and finish times while capturing a snapshot with the device camera (where available) to discourage dishonest time keeping. 

The administration area allows shifts to be approved by a supervisor before they are included in the daily or weekly reports.
